# Cross-Contamination Prevention

Cross-contamination occurs when harmful bacteria or allergens are transferred from one food, surface, or object to another. This is one of the leading causes of foodborne illness.

> **⚠️ Critical**: Preventing cross-contamination is everyone's responsibility. One mistake can make customers seriously ill.

## Types of Cross-Contamination

### 1. Food-to-Food

Direct contact between raw and ready-to-eat foods:

- Raw chicken touching prepared salad
- Raw meat juices dripping onto vegetables
- Using the same container for raw and cooked foods

### 2. Equipment-to-Food

Contaminated equipment transferring bacteria:

- Cutting boards not properly sanitized
- Knives used for raw meat then vegetables
- Containers not cleaned between uses

### 3. People-to-Food

Team members transferring contaminants:

- Unwashed hands touching ready-to-eat food
- Sneezing or coughing near food
- Touching face or hair then handling food

## Color-Coded Cutting Boards

We use a color-coded system to prevent cross-contamination:

| Color | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| 🔴 Red | Raw beef, pork, lamb |
| 🟡 Yellow | Raw poultry (chicken, turkey) |
| 🔵 Blue | Raw fish and seafood |
| 🟢 Green | Fruits and vegetables |
| 🟤 Brown | Cooked meats |
| ⚪ White | Dairy and bread products |

> **💡 Tip**: Remember "Red for red meat, Yellow for poultry, Blue for the sea (fish)."

## Storage Guidelines

### Refrigerator Organization

Store foods from top to bottom in this order:

1. **Top shelf**: Ready-to-eat foods, leftovers, dairy
2. **Middle shelves**: Fruits, vegetables, cooked items
3. **Lower shelves**: Raw beef, pork, lamb
4. **Bottom shelf**: Raw poultry (most likely to contaminate)

> **ℹ️ Note**: Raw poultry goes on the bottom because it has the highest contamination risk.

### Separation Requirements

- Keep raw foods separate from ready-to-eat foods
- Use separate containers with tight-fitting lids
- Never store food in open containers
- Label all containers with contents and date

## Cleaning and Sanitizing

### The Difference

- **Cleaning**: Removes visible dirt and food particles
- **Sanitizing**: Kills bacteria after cleaning

Both steps are required for food safety.

### Clean-Rinse-Sanitize Process

For all food contact surfaces:

1. **Scrape/Remove** visible food debris
2. **Wash** with hot soapy water
3. **Rinse** with clean water
4. **Sanitize** with approved sanitizer
5. **Air dry** (do not wipe with towels)

### Sanitizer Concentration

| Sanitizer Type | Concentration | Contact Time |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Chlorine (bleach) | 50-100 ppm | 7 seconds |
| Quaternary ammonia | 200-400 ppm | 30 seconds |
| Iodine | 12.5-25 ppm | 30 seconds |

> **⚠️ Critical**: Test sanitizer concentration with test strips at least once per shift.

## High-Risk Situations

Be extra vigilant in these situations:

- Rush periods when shortcuts are tempting
- When preparing allergen-free meals
- During delivery receiving and storage
- When handling ready-to-eat foods
- After cleaning spills or handling waste

## Corrective Actions

If cross-contamination occurs:

1. **Stop** and assess the situation
2. **Discard** any potentially contaminated food
3. **Clean and sanitize** affected surfaces
4. **Notify** the shift manager
5. **Document** the incident
