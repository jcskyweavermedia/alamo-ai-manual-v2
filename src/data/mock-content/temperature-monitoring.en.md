# Temperature Monitoring

All hot foods must be held at **140°F (60°C)** or above. Cold foods must be held at **40°F (4°C)** or below.

> **⚠️ Critical**: Temperature checks should be performed every 2 hours during service and logged in the temperature monitoring sheet.

## Checking Temperatures

Use calibrated thermometers to check internal temperatures. Follow these steps:

1. Use a calibrated thermometer
2. Insert the probe into the thickest part of the food
3. Wait for reading to stabilize (15-20 seconds)
4. Record temperature on monitoring sheet
5. Clean and sanitize thermometer between uses

### Hot Holding Requirements

| Food Type | Minimum Temp | Check Frequency |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Soups & Stews | 140°F (60°C) | Every 2 hours |
| Proteins (chicken, beef) | 140°F (60°C) | Every 2 hours |
| Sauces & Gravies | 140°F (60°C) | Every 2 hours |
| Rice & Pasta | 140°F (60°C) | Every 2 hours |

### Cold Holding Requirements

Keep the following items at **40°F (4°C)** or below at all times:

- Salads and prepared salad items
- Dairy products (milk, cheese, cream)
- Cut fruits and vegetables
- Deli meats and sliced proteins
- Desserts with dairy

## The Danger Zone

> **💡 Tip**: The "Danger Zone" is between 41°F and 139°F—bacteria grow rapidly in this range.

Food should never remain in the danger zone for more than **2 hours total**. This includes:

- Time during preparation
- Time during cooking (before reaching safe temp)
- Time during cooling
- Time during holding

## Corrective Actions

If food is found in the danger zone (41-139°F):

### Less than 2 hours in danger zone

1. **Hot food**: Reheat to 165°F (74°C) within 2 hours
2. **Cold food**: Cool to 40°F (4°C) or below immediately
3. Document the incident on the temperature log

### More than 2 hours in danger zone

1. **Discard the food immediately**
2. Document the incident
3. Notify the shift manager
4. Identify and correct the cause

> **ℹ️ Note**: When in doubt, throw it out. Food safety is never worth the risk.

## Thermometer Calibration

Calibrate thermometers at least once per shift using the ice-point method:

1. Fill a container with crushed ice and water
2. Insert thermometer probe into the mixture
3. Wait 30 seconds for reading to stabilize
4. Thermometer should read 32°F (0°C) ± 2°F
5. If not accurate, adjust or replace the thermometer
