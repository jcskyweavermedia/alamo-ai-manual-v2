What is a Prime Steakhouse?
What does it mean to be a prime steakhouse? A prime steakhouse is an establishment that dedicates itself to serving the highest-quality cuts of beef and accompaniments in an upscale, refined dining setting. A prime steakhouse takes classic American steakhouse traditions and elevates them to a superior level, creating an exceptional and memorable dining experience. A traditional restaurant focuses on variety. A prime steakhouse focuses on mastering the art of the perfect steak, complemented by an outstanding beverage program and impeccable side dishes. Alamo Prime Steakhouse strives for excellence in food, drinks and service, while providing a warm, sophisticated, and comfortable setting.

Basics
You are our guests first contact with Alamo Prime, whether by phone or in person. Greet every guest with a warm smile and a friendly hello over the phone.
Guest Service Standards
Our concept is based on warm, personal, and friendly service to create a refined and comfortable atmosphere for our guests and team. Be sure that everything you do will reflect and promote that principle.
Maintain eye contact and a friendly smile whenever interacting with our guests.
Learn and use our guests' names.
Recognize, greet and seat guests personally and professionally.
Personalize our guests dining experience by reading the chit. Get to know our guests. Know our menu, daily specials, signature cocktails, wine list, and bourbon selection.
Anticipate our guests' needs. Your goal should be to offer the guest what they want or need before ever having to ask for it. By the same token, never assume anything. If you are not sure how the guest would like to be served, you must ASK!
Remain available at all times. If you are not available or fail to interact with our guests, you cannot provide first-class service.
Remember, guests always have the right of way. If you are passing a guest, move to the side and allow the guest to pass while smiling, making eye contact, and saying "hello", "good evening" etc.
If a guest asks for the location of the restrooms, lead your guest to them. Never just give verbal instructions or point.
Strive to do the right thing. Your actions are a reflection not only of you, but of our entire team.
Never take shortcuts!! Doing things the right way will yield better results.
BEST PRACTICE ** The best servers in the industry always share one major quality. It's called CONFIDENCE! Exude confidence to our guests by always doing the following:
Know your product well! Understand how to paint a picture for the guest for all of our exceptional offerings and help them choose what best suits them, not us. Know your cuts, your temperatures, your sides, and your pairings. Keep the guests best interests in mind.
Remain calm and in control in the dining room, no matter how busy or bad the situation at hand may be. Like a duck in the pond, remain beautiful and elegant above water, but pedal at 100 mph underwater where it is not visible.

Professionalism
You should carry yourself in a professional manner at all times. Remember you not only represent yourself but our company. Makes us proud! Examples of how you should conduct yourself are:
Eye contact: Is an extremely important form of communication. It demonstrates confidence and interest in what is being said. You must ALWAYS keep eye contact with the guest while interacting with them.
Smile: A smile sets the tone. When you smile, everyone around you smiles as well. A smile is a powerful tool in setting the atmosphere and adding to a great guest experience.
Body language: This is a telling sign of how you are feeling. If the guests see you standing straight and walking tall, it shows you are engaged and ready to go. If they see you leaning or hunched over, head down and walking with a slouch, the guest will think you are not engaged or happy to be here. Remember… if you are having a good day share it! If you are having a bad day… Be a professional and smile anyway.
Tone of voice: Your tone of voice speaks volumes of how you feel. You must always watch your tone and ensure there are never any elements of unintended sarcasm. Keep your tone soft, smooth and pleasant at all time and with everyone you interact with.
Your position at the table: Always position yourself across from the guest whenever possible, so they are not turning their neck to see you in an uncomfortable position.
BEST PRACTICE** When addressing a large group, always project your voice to the guests, and ensure you are addressing the entire table. Sometimes shifting from one side of the table to the other when talking to a large group can prove useful and engaging.
The language you use: Avoid using language which is considered unprofessional. Avoid slangs and terms such as, "you guys", "HI guys", "Wasssuuuuupppp", etc. When speaking to the guests use professional vocabulary. Be relaxed and not stiff or uncomfortable. Be yourself but always be professional.
Food Allergies
Food allergies occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks a food protein. Ingestion of the offending food may trigger the sudden release of chemicals, including histamine, resulting in symptoms of an allergic reaction. The symptoms may be mild (rashes, hives, itching, swelling, etc.) or severe (trouble breathing, wheezing, loss of consciousness, etc.). A food allergy can be potentially fatal.
Symptoms: may include one or more of the following: a tingling sensation in the mouth, swelling of the tongue and throat, difficulty breathing, hives, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, drop in blood pressure, loss of consciousness, and even death. Symptoms typically appear within minutes and up to two hours after the person has eaten the food to which he or she is allergic to.
Food allergens: Eight foods account for 90% of all food-allergic reactions. They are milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat and soy.
Food intolerances: Differ from a food allergy, as the immune system is not involved when a person is intolerant to a food. Two common intolerances are lactose intolerance and Celiac disease.
Lactose intolerance – occurs when an individual's small intestine does not produce enough of the lactase enzyme. Therefore, affected individuals are not able to digest lactose, a type of sugar found in dairy products.
The symptoms of lactose intolerance typically occur within 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingesting dairy products. Large doses of dairy may cause increased symptoms.
Celiac disease – is an adverse reaction to gluten. This disease requires a lifelong restriction of gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, and barley, and perhaps oats. These grains and their by-products must be strictly avoided by people with celiac disease.
Celiac disease can cause several symptoms, including bloating and gas, diarrhea, constipation, headaches, itchy skin rash, and pale mouth sores.
Warm Welcome & Seating the Guests
Everyone will be called upon to help seat our guests when necessary. As a server, you must learn and understand how to seat our guests properly.
When a guest arrives at Alamo Prime, you must always make eye contact, smile, greet, and welcome the guest. If you have the opportunity, open the door for the guest.
Whenever possible, greet guests by their name.
When a table is available and the guests are ready to be seated, the host will hand the seater (could be you seating the guests) a chit with the guests' name and notes, if the guests are celebrating a special occasion.
If guests are carrying beverages or personal items, offer to assist them to their table.
Strike up a conversation with our guests while guiding them, at a slow and steady pace, to their tables.
When seating a guest, if possible, pull out their chair, (ladies first).
Always place menus in the guest's hands.
Always explain what the daily specials are, what the beverage and bourbon selections entail, and happy hour, if applicable. This should not take more than 10-12 seconds.
Example 1
"This is our menu, featuring premium cuts of beef, fresh seafood, and classic steakhouse appetizers. We also have our daily specials, which the Chef prepares fresh. Our beverage menu includes an extensive bourbon and whiskey collection, a curated wine list, and handcrafted cocktails. Enjoy your evening!"
Example 2
"The Chef has prepared some wonderful specials this evening, which you'll find on the insert. We also have an outstanding bourbon collection, a world-class wine list, and signature cocktails. Enjoy!"
BEST PRACTICE ** There will be times where you will have to assist the hostess seat tables. Make sure you understand all of the steps above so you can be ready at all times!
Transferring Checks
You will encounter occasions when guests have begun their dining experience at the bar and would now like to continue it in the dining room. There will be guests who will prefer transferring their check from the bar to the table. Our guests are allowed to transfer their checks, and ultimately it will be the bartender's responsibility to transfer the check, but it is your job to ensure the check transfer is performed. When you become aware a check needs to be transferred, seek out any manager and have them transfer the check.
First Approach - The Greeting
The greeting has several parts that must be covered: name and introduction, beverage order, water type, appetizer mention.
1. Name & Introduction.
Your introduction
Address the guest by their last name (if you cannot pronounce their name ask for help, if in doubt don't use the name).
Acknowledgement of special occasion.
"Congratulations Mr. Smith!! Happy Birthday!"
Ask if this is anyone's first time at the restaurant.
IF THIS IS THEIR FIRST TIME TO THE RESTAURANT:
All new guests need to be informed about the following:
A. We are a prime steakhouse featuring the finest cuts of beef and an exceptional dining experience.
B. Our menu is designed as a traditional coursed experience — appetizers, entrées with your choice of sides, and desserts.
C. Our steaks are hand-selected, aged, and cooked to your preferred temperature. Our Chef takes great pride in every cut that leaves the kitchen.
D. We feature an outstanding bourbon and whiskey program, along with a curated wine list designed to complement our menu.
Example 1
"Welcome to Alamo Prime Mr. Smith! It's a pleasure to have you here. Is this your first time dining with us?"
"Actually, it is!"
"That's wonderful! We are a prime steakhouse and our menu features hand-selected cuts of beef, fresh seafood, and classic steakhouse appetizers. Your meal will be coursed — we'll start you with appetizers, then move to your entrée with your choice of sides, and finish with dessert if you'd like. We also have an exceptional bourbon and whiskey collection."
Example 2
"Mr. Garcia, thank you for choosing Alamo Prime. You are in for a treat! Have you ever dined with us before?"
"No, this is my first time."
"Wonderful. We are a prime steakhouse featuring the finest cuts of beef, all hand-selected and aged. Our menu is coursed — we'll begin with appetizers, move to your steak or entrée with your choice of premium sides, and wrap up with dessert. Our Chef takes incredible care with every dish, and we have a bourbon collection that is truly second to none."
BEST PRACTICE** Infuse the greeting with your own personality. Always cover the main points, but figure out new ways of delivering the message. Practice your spiel, listen to how others do it, and come up with a style that suits you best. The best servers always learn from others. Ensure that you ask your guests if they are in a hurry to catch a show or some other engagement.
IF THEY HAVE BEEN TO THE RESTAURANT BEFORE:
Welcome the guests back and thank them for choosing us once again
Proceed to beverage order
2. Beverage Order
Ask the guests if they are interested in a cocktail/bourbon/wine offering.
Example
"May I interest you in a cocktail or a glass of wine to start the evening?"
"Would you like to explore our bourbon collection, or perhaps a handcrafted cocktail?"
"Do you care for a glass of wine, or perhaps one of our signature cocktails?"
Always direct the guests to the beverage menu as you make a suggestion for him/her
Example
Guest, "I would like a cocktail"
"Here is our beverage menu (open and point at the cocktail page). Our Smoked Old Fashioned is a guest favorite — it's made with premium bourbon, a touch of maple, and a hint of smoke. Another excellent choice is our Espresso Martini, which is smooth and absolutely delicious!"
Try to determine what the guests' likes are, and offer two suggestions based on that.
Example
"A cocktail sounds good! Can I see your cocktail list?"
"Absolutely! Here is our beverage menu, where you can find our signature cocktails. Do you enjoy bourbon or whiskey?"
"I do!"
"You'll love our Smoked Old Fashioned (pointing at the menu) — it's our most popular cocktail. If you prefer something with a bit more kick, our Spicy Manhattan is made with rye whiskey and a touch of jalapeño honey. It's outstanding!"
If the guest prefers a specific cocktail that is not on the cocktail list, always ask if they have a liquor preference. If after 2 seconds the guest does not respond, suggest two options for that cocktail.
Example
"I would like a whiskey sour."
"Do you have a bourbon preference?" Pause 2 seconds… "Do you care for Woodford Reserve or Maker's Mark?"
BEST PRACTICE ** Never use the word well liquors. It's always our house liquors. We do not use low quality liquors, and we want to portray this in our verbiage. Also, if the guest asks you for well liquor, they want the cheapest brand you have. Make sure you always know which brand is part of our house liquors. House liquors are the lowest in price.
3. Water Type
Ask the guests for water preferences, regular or bottled. Then determine if they prefer still or sparkling. Our regular water is filtered at the restaurant.
Example
"Do you care for regular or bottled water this evening?"
"Bottled, please."
"Sure, do you care for still or sparkling?"
4. Appetizer Mention
Read your guests, and determine if you can proceed with the appetizer mention. Some guests are very interested in talking to one another, others are in business meetings. But a lot of our guests are food enthusiasts and love to listen to suggestions.
Ask the guests if they would like to hear some appetizer suggestions. If they do, point out 2-3 selections from the menu.
Example
"We have an excellent selection of appetizers and some phenomenal seafood starters. May I make a suggestion?"
"I need a couple of minutes"
"No problem, I will be right back with your Old Fashioned."
Example
"To start, we have some outstanding appetizers. May I make a recommendation?"
"Sounds good!"
"Our Shrimp Cocktail is a guest favorite — four jumbo shrimp served chilled with our house-made cocktail sauce. If you're looking for something a bit heartier, our Wedge Salad is a classic — crisp iceberg lettuce, applewood smoked bacon, blue cheese crumbles, and cherry tomatoes. Would you like to start with either of those?"
BEST PRACTICE** When making an appetizer recommendation, always make it a point to ask if the guest would like to order one of your selections or perhaps try something else. Think of the many times you have gone to eat, and the server/waitress offers you something appetizing, but fails to take the order, and instead he/she runs away to get you the drinks.
Second Approach – Beverage Delivery & Entrée Presentation
All beverages must be delivered on a tray. If there are no trays….go get some!
Always serve ladies first.
All beverages, (except stem ware) must be served with a cocktail napkin underneath it.
Drinks should be served within 3 to 5 minutes of being ordered.
Drinks should be delivered by name.
All labels of any bottle product must face the guest.
Present the steak knife selection or butter board at the appropriate time, per house standards.
Once all drinks have been delivered, proceed to make 2 to 3 recommendations. At least one of the recommendations should be from our daily specials.
Example
"If I may take a moment to share some highlights. The Chef has prepared some outstanding specials this evening. Tonight we are featuring a 22-ounce dry-aged bone-in ribeye, seasoned with our house blend and finished with herb butter — it is exceptional. From the regular menu, one of my personal favorites is our Filet Mignon. It's an 8-ounce center-cut filet, incredibly tender, and pairs beautifully with our Creamed Spinach or Truffle Mac & Cheese. It's an outstanding combination!"
Once the recommendations are made, always ask if they have any questions about the menu or if they are ready to order now.
Example
"Do you have any questions about the menu? Would you like me to take your order?"
Example
"Are there any questions I may answer for you? Are you ready to order?"
Taking the Order
Once your guests are ready to order, you must have your chit and pen ready to go. You should begin with ladies first, if possible. As each guest orders you must REPEAT the ORDER back to them. This ensures an ACCURATE ORDER. Make sure you provide as many details as possible about each item. If you have any doubts about a guest's order, you must ASK.
When taking steak orders, you must ALWAYS confirm the following:
The cut and size
The desired temperature (rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, well done)
Any additions or toppings (blue cheese crust, peppercorn sauce, sautéed mushrooms, etc.)
Their choice of sides
If a guest is unsure about a temperature, describe them clearly:
Rare – Cool red center
Medium Rare – Warm red center (our most popular temperature)
Medium – Warm pink center
Medium Well – Slight hint of pink
Well Done – No pink, cooked through
BEST PRACTICE**
Repeat the order to each guest individually when your guest has finished ordering. Do not repeat the order to all of your guests as a group. This is not the upscale way to do it. Once you take the order of one person, immediately repeat it back and then proceed to the next guest.
Coursing Explained
At Alamo Prime, all meals follow a traditional coursed dining format. This allows each course to be enjoyed fully before the next arrives, and enables our kitchen to execute each dish with the care and precision it deserves.
How does the coursing method work?
Your job is to guide the guest through their meal in a logical progression — appetizers first, then entrées with sides, and finally desserts. The coursing method ensures our guests are never overwhelmed and that every dish arrives at its peak.
Rules for coursing are as follows:
Appetizer Course: All appetizer orders are rung in first. Cold appetizers (such as shrimp cocktail, oysters, or wedge salad) will typically fire immediately. Hot appetizers (such as crab cakes or bacon-wrapped scallops) will follow shortly after.
When coursing, explain to your guests that their meal will be served in courses so they understand the progression. If any objections are brought up to you, handle them with good judgement.
Ensure you never overwhelm the table. Entrées should never be delivered while appetizer plates are still on the table.
Entrée Course: Once the appetizer course has been cleared, fire the entrée course. All steak and entrée orders for the table should fire at the same time so the entire table is served together.
Side Dishes: Sides are delivered alongside the entrée course. Ensure all sides arrive at the same time as the steaks.
Dessert Course: Only after the entrée course has been fully cleared and the table has been crumbed should you present the dessert menu or make dessert recommendations.
Always ensure each place setting has the proper utensils for the course being served.
Best practices ** When coursing, it is very important you use common sense. If you have a table where two guests order appetizers and one does not, ring in the appetizers and hold the entrées until the appetizer course is cleared. The goal is that the entire table moves through the meal together.
Here is an example of a table's order and how you would course their selections:
Table of 3 Order:
Shrimp Cocktail
Wedge Salad
French Onion Soup
12 oz New York Strip (medium rare) with Creamed Spinach
8 oz Filet Mignon (medium) with Truffle Mac & Cheese
16 oz Bone-In Ribeye (medium rare) with Loaded Baked Potato
Chocolate Lava Cake
New York Cheesecake
How to ring in:
First course (Appetizers):
Shrimp Cocktail
Wedge Salad
French Onion Soup
Second course (Entrées & Sides):
12 oz New York Strip (medium rare) with Creamed Spinach
8 oz Filet Mignon (medium) with Truffle Mac & Cheese
16 oz Bone-In Ribeye (medium rare) with Loaded Baked Potato
Third course (Desserts):
Chocolate Lava Cake
New York Cheesecake
The first course consists of appetizers and lighter items. These arrive first while the guests' appetites are fresh. The second course is the main event — steaks and entrées with their sides, all delivered to the table at the same time so every guest eats together. The third course is dessert, served only after the entrée course has been fully cleared and the table has been crumbed and reset. This progression ensures our guests enjoy a seamless, unhurried dining experience, exactly as our Chef envisioned it.
Food Delivery Times
Appetizers
Appetizers will traditionally take 5 to 10 minutes to prepare and arrive at table.
Entrées
Entrées and steaks will take approximately 12-18 minutes to make and deliver to table, depending on temperature and cut.
Desserts
Desserts will take approximately 4 to 8 minutes to arrive at table.
Pre-bussing & Table Maintenance
Plates and utensils have to be cleared between courses as necessary and replaced. All crumbs must be removed as well. Make sure the plates are clean and dry.
Drinks – refill all sodas, teas, and water. You refill a beverage when it is below half the glass.
Plating for desserts – ensure the table is cleaned, crumbed, and pre-bussed before desserts arrive. Always bring the appropriate dessert utensils — forks and spoons.
Fold napkins – when a guest leaves the table, for whatever reason, you will take the guest's napkin and fold it; then place it upon the table where they are seated.
The Check
Audit your check to ensure everything has been rung in accurately.
Place check in a neutral position. Make sure the check presenter is standing up and the spin is facing the guest.
Inform guests that you will pick up the check whenever they are ready
Once they offer tender, return change or credit card receipt as soon as possible.
When you return their change or receipt, draw the guests' attention to our email subscription card and invite them to join. Explain the benefits of joining the program.
Thank your guests by name and invite them to return.
Service Do's and Don'ts
Whenever possible, serve food from the left and remove from the right.
Serve beverages from a tray, and to the right of the guest.
Never reach across a guest to serve or remove an item.
Whenever possible, serve ladies first.
When delivering any bottled products; for example, beer, wine, bottled water, serve with label facing the guest. When placing bottles on table make sure the labels are facing the guest.
When replacing silverware, it must always be delivered on linen.
Always ask, "May I remove?", before you remove anything from the table.
Situations That May Occur / Guest Issues
A guest's meal was not prepared as they liked (e.g., steak temperature is incorrect):
First and foremost, apologize.
Second - remove the item and immediately inform the kitchen of how the guest would like the item prepared (correct temperature, different preparation, etc.).
Third - inform a FOH manager and the Chef in charge.
The Chef will always send a complimentary appetizer or small item for the guest that has to be delivered within 1-2 minutes of the issue.
Fourth - replace used cutlery with new cutlery.
Fifth - ensure when the new item arrives, it is as the guest likes and that the manager has approached the table and spoken with the guest.
Check back with the guest after they have had 2 bites or 2 minutes with item.
The food is taking longer than the expected ticket time. Food over 5-10 minutes of their expected ticket time is considered a long ticket time:
Inform a FOH manager and HOH manager
If the food is late, it is ultimately your responsibility. If you inform management within 5 minutes of the dish being late, it becomes the manager's responsibility and not yours.
The manager should pass by the table and assess the situation. The manager would then determine if we need to send a complimentary appetizer to appease the guest and/or cocktails.
You spill something on a guest:
Apologize.
Assist in cleaning the spill quickly, and inform a manager.
Lastly, ensure a manager visits the table.
The guest did not like their food:
Apologize.
Remove the item immediately.
Ask the guest if they would care for a replacement item.
The item most likely will not be charged on the bill. This is up to the manager on duty.
How to Handle a Complaint
With any situation, you must always remain calm, cool, and collected. Be professional. Perform the following steps:
Acknowledge the complaint.
Apologize sincerely
Act quickly.
Be positive.
Always communicate with your managers of any occurrences immediately so they can approach the guest when necessary.
Take ownership of the situation.
Being Part of a Team While Serving the Guest
Working as a team may be the most important part of your job. Only working as a team can we maintain our company standards and ensure that our guests have an extraordinary experience. It is your responsibility to:
Greet all guests.
Help clear any and all tables.
Run food whenever possible.
Fulfill all the guests' needs.
Ask and offer help to all your fellow team members
If you see a guest or team member in need of help it is your job to help. You must make sure you do all you can to help assist in fulfilling their needs.
Team service means anyone and everyone helps in all aspects of the restaurant, regardless of the task.

Glossary
Prime – The highest USDA beef grade, indicating superior marbling, tenderness, and flavor. Only about 2-3% of all beef earns the Prime designation.
Marbling – The white flecks of intramuscular fat within a cut of beef. More marbling generally means more flavor and tenderness.
Dry-Aged – A process where beef is stored in a controlled, open-air environment for an extended period (typically 21-45 days). This concentrates flavor and enhances tenderness.
Wet-Aged – A process where beef is vacuum-sealed and aged in its own juices. This method retains moisture and produces a milder flavor than dry-aging.
Filet Mignon – The most tender cut of beef, taken from the smaller end of the tenderloin. Known for its buttery texture and mild flavor.
Ribeye – A richly marbled cut from the rib section. Known for its bold, beefy flavor and juicy texture. Available bone-in or boneless.
